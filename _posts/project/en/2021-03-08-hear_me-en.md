## What?

HearMe is a cross platform mobile application providing a novel way to stay aware of people calling you.

This is a project that our team (Vcamp Soldiers) completed in 36 hrs in TartanHacks 2021.

Winner of the üèÜ Microsoft Azure Champ Prize : Hack For Social Good!! üèÜ 


## Inspiration

One of the main methods of communication in this world is verbal. However, our team has noticed that there are many issues with verbal communication in the world that can be fixed with technology.

Many people nowadays use headphones to block out the world around them when working hard on their job, focusing on homework, or simply going for a walk. However, this comes with the cost of being unable to hear others around them. We also found that modern technology still has its limitations in helping those who are hearing impaired interact with those around them.

Hence, we believe that HearMe has the potential to provide many users a radical new method of verbal communication.

## How?

HearMe is a mobile application built on the Flutter framework using Microsoft Azure‚Äôs speech-to-text and speaker recognition API.

Users only need to go through a one-time, simple setup process of entering their name and providing a 20 second audio sample of them reading a prompt aloud. Once users turn on the microphone with HearMe, users will be notified whenever their name is called and if the person calling their name is a friend, the name of that friend will also be shown as a notification.

Friends can simply be added by providing the email to that friend‚Äôs HearMe account.
